\f0\fs24 \cf0 This program, given a list of words, separates anagrams into equivalence classes and lists the classes that have the greatest number of members in lexicographical order. The input consists of 2 integers 'n' and 'm' both greater than 0 on the first line separated by a single space. 'n' is number of words being inputted and 'm' is the number of classes you want to be printed. Next, input your words one word per line. The program will group together the anagrams then output m classes from largest class to smallest class.\
